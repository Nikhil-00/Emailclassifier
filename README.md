The Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning-based application designed to detect whether an email is spam or not. Using the Random Forest Classifier, the model achieved an accuracy of 82%. The project incorporated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing, such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, followed by converting textual data into vectorized form for model training. The user interface was developed using Streamlit, enabling users to interact with the model and classify emails in real-time. This project emphasizes efficient data cleaning pipelines and showcases expertise in machine learning, NLP, and user-friendly UI development.
